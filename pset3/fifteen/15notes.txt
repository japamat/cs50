notes on proceeding through problem

4.  built init function, found that an array was initialized and tested proper swapping if d is even

5.  after building draw, inserted init code to give myself an array to test printing

6.  building move, decided to abstract things down into a few funtions
        
        6.1 in move, we need to do the following things:
            6.1.a   check that input is valid and find that tile's location in array
            6.1.b   check that move is legal move (i.e. directly adjacent to blank)
            6.1.c   swap selected tile with blank
